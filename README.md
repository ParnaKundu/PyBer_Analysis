# PyBer_Analysis
Matplotlib Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis of data for a Python-based ridesharing app company, PyBer, and to generate a multi-line graph depicting the total weekly fares for different city types - Urban, Suburbans and Rural.

## Results

The ride-share data for all cities is analyzed and summarized based on the city types. 

The results [Ride_share_summary]() indicate that the urban cities have a higher count of rides over the rural and suburban cities. In addition, the urban cities have the most drivers which results in a lower average fare per driver. 

All city types have a comparable average fare per ride.

Analysis of the fares for each city type over a four month period indicates a steady inflow of revenue. The comparison for each city type can be seen in [PyBer_fare_summary](). This chart clearly shows how the urban cities have the maximum usage of the ride-share program.

## Summary

Looking at the analysis of the ride-share data [PyBer_fare_summary](), the following are the recommendations :-

- The number of drivers in rural and suburban areas can be increased to increase the usage.

- All three city types seem to have a similar fluctuation in the usage during the month of March. More analysis can be done to determine the cause and if appropriate, incentives can be given to customers to increase the usage. 

- Since the urban cities have the maximum usage, increasing the drivers in these cities will increase the revenue further.
